# C0mrad Roadmap

Welcome to the **C0mrad Roadmap**, a detailed guide outlining the journey of building a no-code DeFi automation app on 0G’s modular Layer 1 blockchain. 

## Wave 1: Ideation and Prototype Development
 
**Objective**: Lay the foundation by brainstorming ideas and creating a functional demo to validate the concept.  

- **Tasks**:  
  - Conduct market research to identify DeFi user pain points (e.g., complexity, cost).  
  - Sketch a no-code drag-and-drop interface for trading workflows.  
  - Build a prototype using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.  
  - Deploy a basic smart contract on 0G Chain’s testnet for token swaps.  
  - Experiment with 0G Compute for a simple AI price predictor and 0G Storage for workflow saving.  

- **Features Delivered**:  
  - A working demo with a drag-and-drop UI for creating a basic trading strategy.  
  - Initial smart contract integration on 0G testnet.  
  - Conceptual framework for AI and storage integration.  

- **Illustration**:  
  A cosmic launchpad where a rocket labeled "C0mrad" takes off from a blueprint-filled planet "Ideation." The rocket’s trail forms a path to a glowing "Demo" star, with orbiting satellites labeled "0G Chain," "0G Compute," and "0G Storage."
